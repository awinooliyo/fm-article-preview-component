## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This excercise exposed me to new concepts in so far as CSS is concerned. I was also able to remind myself quite a bit about JS.

### Continued development

I want to start learning CSS grid because I entirely focused on using CSS flexbox for this solution. I also want to develop and ground mysekf more into JS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/word-break) - This helped me handle wordbreak instead of using the `<br>`.
- [Example resource 2](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me find my way through flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
